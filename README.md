# Josh's Progress

## Week 1 Progress:

This week with Jordan I created the balloon that we will implement on our main menu secreen and may implement into the game itself.
Theoretically the gif that I drew would run in our main menu but I am unsure wether it will once I implement images into the code.
Implemented images of the balloon into the code. Tried to put hand in but ran out of time.
